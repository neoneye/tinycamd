Tinycamd is an efficient daemon to serve images from Video4Linux2 web
cameras to HTTP. It is particularly well suited to UVC (USB Video
Class) webcams.

Tinycamd runs happily and speedily on WRT54 family routers. On a 1GHz
x86 centrino-M it consumes about 1% of the CPU to serve a camera.

    /image.jpg is the current frame.
    /setup.html lets you adjust the camera.

Tinycamd will need a TCP/IP port where people may connect to it. You
may choose to bind only to the local device and use your web server,
and its security infrastructure, to proxy to the camera.
